This application was designed as part of the video game:
Unknown Number, by Godolphin Games: [View on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1692340/Unknown_Number_A_First_Person_Talker/)

The website [crypto-transfer.co.uk](http://crypto-transfer.co.uk/) is displayed inside of the game via an in-game browser. You will need a passcode, obtained during the game, to view the whole experience.

While developers may find some useful code in here, this project was published to Github primarily as part of the portfolio of designer & developer, Freja Smith.

This project was built using Create React App and includes:
* Valtio State Management
* React Player that plays webm, mp4 and Vimeo video sources
* Loading screen for video player
* React Device Detect
* A custom progress bar with % counter
* SVG as JS components

Plus some fun CSS rules including:
* border-image
* custom image as cursor
* mix-blend-mode
* linear-gradient as background
* CSS global variables

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
